/**
 * The solution for problems like this is the synchronized key word in Java. With
 * synchronized you can create blocks of statements which can only be accessed by a
 * thread, which gets the lock on the synchronized resource. Letâ€™s change the run()
 * method from the last example and introduce a synchronized block for the whole
 * class:
 * 
 * The synchronized(SynchronizedCounter.class) statement works like a barrier where
 * all threads have to stop and ask for entrance. Only the first thread that gets
 * the lock on the resources is allowed to pass. Once it has left the synchronized
 * block, another waiting thread can enter and so forth.
 * 
 * The synchronized(SynchronizedCounter.class) statement works like a barrier where
 * all threads have to stop and ask for entrance. Only the first thread that gets
 * the lock on the resources is allowed to pass. Once it has left the synchronized
 * block, another waiting thread can enter and so forth.
 * 
 * With the synchronized block around the output and increment of the counter above
 * the output looks like the following example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 	[thread-1] before: 11
 * 	[thread-1] after: 12
 * 	[thread-4] before: 12
 * 	[thread-4] after: 13
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Now you will see only subsequent outputs of before and after that increment the
 * counter variable by one.
 * 
 * The synchronized keyword can be used in two different ways. It can either be used
 * within a method as shown above. In this case you have to provide a resource that
 * is locked by the current thread. This resource has to be chosen carefully because
 * the thread barrier becomes a completely different meaning based on the scope of
 * the variable.
