/**
 * *Alternatively, a thread may use static interrupted() method to check if it was
 * interrupted. The method returns a true if the interrupt flag is set; false
 * otherwise. So, a thread, on its way to normal work, may devote some time to
 * inspect the methodâ€™s return value as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * while (true) {
 * 	// do normal work
 * 	// check it was interrupted
 * 	if (Thread.interrupted()) {
 * 		// it was interrupted, respond
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Note that interrupted()method clears the interrupt flag of the thread. This means
 * if the method is called twice in succession, the second call would return false
 * unless the current thread is interrupted again in the meanwhile.
